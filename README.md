## 📌 Executive Summary & 30-Second Pitch

> **"Cyclopath AI is an AI-powered disaster intelligence and infrastructure vulnerability platform for cyclone-prone Indian communities. It combines cyclone atmospheric forecasts, satellite and geospatial data, critical asset telemetry, machine learning, and Google Gemini-powered reasoning to identify vulnerable infrastructure before a cyclone makes landfall. Instead of only telling authorities where the cyclone is heading, Cyclopath AI predicts which hospitals, power substations, bridges, and shelters will fail, explains *why* using Explainable AI (SHAP factors), calculates flood-safe evacuation routes via Dijkstra graph algorithms, and synthesizes prioritized, role-specific emergency action plans in English, Hindi, and Marathi."**

## 🎯 The Problem: Solving for India's 7,516 km Coastline

Every year, severe cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea threaten coastal states including **Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Gujarat**.

While the India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides high-accuracy atmospheric storm tracks, a massive operational gap remains for district disaster authorities:
1. **Raw Weather ≠ Infrastructure Risk**: A 150 km/h wind warning does not tell municipal authorities whether District Hospital A will lose power, or if Bridge B will become impassable due to a 3.5m storm surge.
2. **Delayed Response Protocols**: Emergency teams spend critical pre-landfall hours manually cross-referencing maps, flood elevations, and hospital backup generator logs.
3. **Black-Box Confusion**: First responders cannot blindly trust an opaque AI risk score without transparent, explainable factor attributions.
4. **Multilingual Barrier**: Ground-level emergency teams and citizens in rural coastal belts need urgent guidance in their local languages (**Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Bengali**).

**Cyclopath AI solves this by transforming RAW DATA ➔ RISK SCORE ➔ SHAP EXPLANATION ➔ ACTIONABLE ADVISORY.**

## 🎬 3-Minute Hackathon Demo Script

Follow this chronological walkthrough during your hackathon presentation:

1. **Minute 0:00 – The Hook & Overview**:
   - Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. Show the dark command center.
   - Explain the core thesis: *"When Cyclone SAMUDRA approaches the Odisha coast, district officials don't need another generic weather widget. They need to know which hospital loses power, which bridge floods, and what action to take first."*
2. **Minute 0:45 – Geospatial Intelligence & Explainable AI**:
   - Switch to **Risk Map**. Point out the Cyclone cone, wind intensity rings, and color-coded infrastructure markers.
   - Click on **Puri District Headquarters Hospital**.
   - Show the **Asset Detail Modal**: Point out the **SHAP factor breakdown** (`+26 Cyclone Proximity`, `+21 Storm Surge`, `+18 Critical Power Dependency`) demonstrating that this is explainable AI, not an ungrounded black box.
3. **Minute 1:30 – What-If Scenario Simulation**:
   - Navigate to **Scenario Simulator**.
   - Increase storm surge from 2.5m to 4.2m and wind speed to 195 km/h. Click **"Run What-If Simulation"**.
   - Show the instant **Before vs. After Delta**: *Critical assets increase from 14 to 31 (+121%)*.
4. **Minute 2:10 – Cyclopath Response Agent & Safe Routing**:
   - Click **AI Response Agent**. Click quick query *"Which hospitals need backup power?"*.
   - Show the **transparent tool-calling execution trace** (`get_infrastructure_risk`, `get_cyclone_status`).
   - Switch to **Emergency Routing** to calculate the flood-safe route between Puri Hospital and Konark Shelter.
5. **Minute 2:45 – Multilingual & Multimodal Vision**:
   - Click the language selector in the navbar: switch to **हिंदी (Hindi)** or **मराठी (Marathi)** to prove grassroots India readiness.
   - Switch to **Image Inspector** to demonstrate Gemini 1.5 analyzing structural crack imagery of a coastal seawall.
